    "Paths - On launch of the main Ui window, the user will see a list of path arguments that must be filled out that are specific to where their own directories are located. Every user will not be able to access the same files due to permission errors so it is important that the user has their own paths to a SynthSeg directory, Dcan-nn-unet, a Task Folder where all of the data is stored, and their raw data base.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Dcan-nn-unet Path - Path to your dcan-nn-unet repo\n",
    "    SynthSeg Path - Path to your SynthSeg repo\n",
    "    Task Path - Path to the folder containing the train and test data for your specific task\n",
    "    Raw Data Base Path - Path to the folder that will contain the raw, preprocessed and cropped data folders for your tasks. This should be a couple directories above your task folder.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    Task Number - The number id given to your specific task. This should match up with your task path.\n",
    "    Number of SynthSeg Generated Images - The number of synthetic images you want SynthSeg to create per age group.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Presets: \n",
    "    The user can create custom presets, which streamline the setup process for new training sessions. This feature not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors, ensuring a smoother and more efficient start.\n",
    "Check Boxes:\n",
    "    Listed on the right side of the screen when launching the main UI window are 8 different check boxes . These are the necessary steps for the model training process. If you want to run the model training from start to finish, keep all the boxes selected, otherwise, you can pick and choose the steps you want to run.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Resize Images - Initial setup step, formats your data to uniformly to be used by SynthSeg and nNUnet.\n",
    "    Mins/Maxes - Creates priors for SynthSeg image generation. These files will be stored within the GUI repo in a subfolder called min_maxes.\n",
    "    SynthSeg Image Creation - Synthetic image creation step, SynthSeg will produce the number of synthetic images/labels you specified. These will be put into a seperate folder within your task folder if you want to do anything with them before copying them over.\n",
    "    Copying Over SynthSeg Images - Moves your synthetic data into your corresponding train folders. \n",
    "    Create JSON File - Creates the metadata that nNUnet needs to train. This JSON file will be put in your task folder.\n",
    "    Plan and Preprocess - nNUnet preprocess step, sets up your dataset and extracts from it the necessary info that nNUnet will need in the model training step.\n",
    "    Training the Model - nnUNet model training step, trains a model using your train data. The model will output to your trained models path.\n",
    "    Running Inference - nnUNet inference step, the trained model will create inferred segmentations for your test data and create plots comparing it to the ground truth labels. These will go in your results folder with ###_infer containing the segmentations and ###_results containing the plots.\n",
